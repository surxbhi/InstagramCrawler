The economy has in fact created seven million jobs," wrote former Trump chief economic advisor Gary Cohn and former Trump chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Kevin Hassett in a Wall Street Journal article. Further, when President Trump took office: "the Federal Reserve\'s median forecast had the unemployment rate inching up toward 5 percent, almost 1.5 percentage points higher than the current 50-year low." Wages: Workers\' wages rose under Trump, but had been rising slightly faster prior to Trump\'s term. wages are at their highest point ever. Cohn and Hassett also note that lowest-income workers have seen the biggest raises this year. "Over the past year, nominal wages for the lowest 10 percent of American workers jumped 7 percent. The growth rate for those without a high-school diploma was 9 percent," they wrote.Stringham says the credit for achieving new economic highs – and for massive stock market growth – goes to the president\'s policies. "The president promised and delivered on two major economic policies that have been very good for markets. Number one is the tax cuts and lowering of corporate tax rates. That encourages more investment in the American economy," he said.\n"Perhaps more importantly ... eliminating harmful economic regulations has clearly been good for American business and markets in general," he added.'}, {'author': 'sungkc', 'comment': 'The Trump economy, three years in: FOX Business ran the numbers, comparing basic economic performance measures before and after Trump\'s election. Stock market: The stock market grew 31 percent in the 807 trading days before Trump\'s election, but it grew by 56 percent in the 807 trading days after it, up through the third anniversary of Trump\'s inauguration. More than half of Americans invest in the stock market, either directly or through 401(k)s and other retirement funds. Economists say the gains show tax cuts and freer markets are working. "The administration policies on tax cuts and deregulation have been good for both Wall Street and Main Street," economist David Henderson, who served on President Ronald Reagan\'s Council of Economic Advisers, told FOX Business. He said the big improvement came even despite an expensive trade war. The outcome is also a far cry what some had predicted. After Trump\'s election, biased Nobel-prize-winning economist Paul Krugman (a former Obama economic advisor) predicted: "We are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight." But overall, manufacturing has risen under the Trump administration, and it has done so faster than before he was president. Manufacturing rose 3.6 percent during Trump\'s three years, which was more than double the rise of 1.7 percent in the three years under Obama before that, according to government data. Unemployment:\nManufacturing employment also rose under Trump, with 487,000 manufacturing jobs created.\nIn contrast, in the three years prior to Trump\'s term, manufacturing employment rose by 287,000 jobs. Unemployment fell under Trump, but it was already falling at a rapid pace before he came to office. Economists say that the continued decline is particularly impressive since the rate is nearing record lows (at the diminishing marginal return extreme curve area). The current rate is lowest it has been in the last 50 years. "We are approaching ... record low unemployment rates and once one gets so close to zero, it cannot continue to fall at the rates that it [used to]," Ed Stringham, President of the American Institute for Economic Research, told FOX Business.'}, {'author': 'fakemail173838', 'comment': 'Trump 2020'}, {'author': 'two_2_zero_f', 'comment': '😁😁'}, {'author': 'brendanday576', 'comment': 'Me👍🏻'}]}

Ghosn told a press conference last week that he had fled to clear his name and said, without naming the president, that the seeds of the crisis at the Franco-Japanese carmaking alliance were sewn when Macron was economy minister. Macron said on Wednesday decisions he had taken "had always defended French interests," adding that it was too convenient to argue that defending national interests could harm an executive. Ghosn said Nissan and Japanese officials were shocked by a decision by the French government in 2015 to increase the state\'s shareholding in Renault and double its voting rights. "This left a big bitterness," Ghosn said last week. The move left the Japanese side of the Renault-Nissan alliance fearing that a national champion was falling under the control of the French government, sources have said.'}]}

Iran now claims on 1/10/2020 that its military “unintentionally” shot down a Ukrainian jetliner this week, killing all 176 people aboard. Iran had previously denied involvement in the crash, contrary to claims from the U.S. and Canada that pointed to Iran. On Thursday (1/9/2019), Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei accused the US and its allies of "lying and engaging in psychological warfare" in their speculation over the cause of the accident. Earlier on Friday (1/10/2010), Iran\'s Civil Aviation Organisation (CAOI) chief Ali Abedzadeh repeated his view that a missile was not the cause of the crash. An Iranian official told the BBC on Friday (1/10/2010) that there was documentation to prove that the plane had a mechanical issue before take-off. It was not signed off for flying, but Ukrainian airline officials had overruled these objections, the official said, without giving further details. Now, we all know Iran lied intentionally. That means that this shooting down of this civilian airplane was intentional. Iran never is to be trusted.'}]}

Pelosi, D-Calif., is apparently using the delay as leverage to extract favorable terms for a Senate trial. But Noah Feldman wrote for Bloomberg that an “indefinite delay” would pose a “serious problem”—as impeachment only technically happens when the articles are transmitted to the Senate. “Both parts are necessary to make an impeachment under the Constitution: The House must actually send the articles and send managers to the Senate to prosecute the impeachment. And the Senate must actually hold a trial,” Feldman wrote. “If the House does not communicate its impeachment to the Senate, it hasn’t actually impeached the president,” he continued. “If the articles are not transmitted, Trump could legitimately say he wasn’t truly impeached at all.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on the floor Thursday seemed baffled at Pelosi’s move to withhold the articles, arguing that the House speaker doesn’t have the leverage she thinks she does.'}, {'author': 'prasad_padmasanka_', 'comment': 'Democrats : hey how do we defeat this guy?

Fishermen Fear the Worst (New York Times news on 12/23/2019): The water from the Fukushima disaster is more radioactive than the authorities have previously publicized, raising doubts about government assurances that it will be made safe. The overpowering earthquake and tsunami that ripped through northern Japan in March 2011 took so much from Tatsuo Niitsuma, a commercial fisherman in this coastal city in Fukushima Prefecture.The tsunami pulverized his fishing boat. It demolished his home. Most devastating of all, it took the life of his daughter. Now, nearly nine years after the disaster, Mr. Niitsuma, 77, is at risk of losing his entire livelihood, too, as the government considers releasing tainted water from a nuclear power plant destroyed by the tsunami’s waves. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet and the Tokyo Electric Power Company — the operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, where a triple meltdown led to the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl — must decide what to do with more than one million tons of contaminated water stored in about 1,000 giant tanks on the plant site.'}, {'author': 'sungkc', 'comment': "Wartime documents shed light on role of Japanese government and military in recruiting 'comfort women' (KYODO from Japan Times on 12/6/2019): The Imperial Japanese Army asked the government to provide one “comfort woman,” or ianfu in Japanese, for every 70 soldiers, according to documents reviewed by Kyodo News on Friday that shed new light on the wartime practice of forcing and coercing women into military brothels. The documents were collected by the Cabinet Secretariat between April 2017 and March 2019. Of the 23 documents, 13 are classified dispatches from Japanese consulates in China to the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo dated 1938, the year after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident that sparked the Second Sino-Japanese War. One dispatch from the consul general of Jinan to the foreign minister reports that the Japanese invasion had caused a surge in prostitution in the area, with a head count of 101 geisha from mainland Japan, 110 comfort women from mainland Japan, and 228 comfort women from the Korean Peninsula, which had been annexed in 1910. The dispatch says that as Japanese forces had made further advances, “at least 500 comfort women must be concentrated here by the end of April.” It also notes that 186 women had ridden south in military vehicles after the occupation of Xuzhou in Jiangsu province. The documents lend weight to the landmark 1993 apology statement by then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono that accepted blame for the Japanese military’s involvement in recruiting comfort women, in many cases against their own will, and apologized to them.Hirofumi Hayashi, a professor at Kanto Gakuin University, said the documents proved that “the military had an active hand in gathering women.”“They were sounding out the Foreign Ministry through the consulates,” he said. The exact number of comfort women remains unknown, with estimates ranging from 20,000 to hundreds of thousands. The women were recruited from mainland Japan, the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan and other countries. The issue continues to be a source of friction between Japan and South Korea. But evil PM Shinjo Abe continues to deny existence of such."}, {'author': 'humansaredestroyingtheplanet', 'comment': 'What a surprise,Jap men raping asian females.

(Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday he had previously spoken to Japan\'s prime minister about the conditions former Nissan-Renault boss Carlos Ghosn was being held under.\nAfter fleeing Japan in late December, Ghosn said he had been treated "brutally" by Tokyo prosecutors and that he was the victim of a conspiracy by Japanese carmaker Nissan.\n"I told (Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe several times that the conditions of Carlos Ghosn\'s detention and questioning did not appear to be satisfactory to me," Macron told reporters. Ghosn told a press conference last week that he had fled to clear his name and said, without naming the president, that the seeds of the crisis at the Franco-Japanese carmaking alliance were sewn when Macron was economy minister. Macron said on Wednesday decisions he had taken "had always defended French interests," adding that it was too convenient to argue that defending national interests could harm an executive. Ghosn said Nissan and Japanese officials were shocked by a decision by the French government in 2015 to increase the state\'s shareholding in Renault and double its voting rights. "This left a big bitterness," Ghosn said last week. The move left the Japanese side of the Renault-Nissan alliance fearing that a national champion was falling under the control of the French government, sources have said.'}]}

I believe that the materialism that is now commonplace and that is increasingly being promoted and encouraged by measures to promote obsolescence comes at a very high price. This price is not, however, borne by those who cause it, nor necessarily by consumers per se. Of course, it is them who pay an excessive price because of excessive consumption, but in the end, it is the workers and the environment who are exploited. I think that this is where the degrowth movement comes in. It is about reducing consumption and production (and therefore the GDP) as a way to achieve greater social justice, environmental sustainability and well-being. In order to achieve this, a change in values is necessary, because if a large part of the people (especially those who can exercise a lot of power) want to own more and more, such a vision cannot be implemented. It is about people understanding that they, just like the environment, animals and everything around them, are part of the ecosystem and must behave accordingly. If, for example, human beings consume an excessive amount of resources, the environment, conversely, must suffer from this exploitation. This fact is particularly evident in the ecological footprint: the United States alone consumes within one year the resources that are actually available for five years - a calculation that will not work out in the long term.\nAt this point, the question of alternative courses of action arises. The video has already shown some very good ways to behave in a more sustainable and socially just manner. Based on research and my own considerations, I have also come to the following points:\n\n1) We should orient ourselves towards a good life for all. If we focus our decisions not only on ourselves but also on our fellow citizens (also including those on the other half of the world), we will act much more consciously and thus also much more sustainably."}, {'author': '_jana74', 'comment': '2) Above all, the global North has an important role to play, because it is the North that must move away from the one-sided Western development paradigm. Southern countries also have a right for development. It has to be started at the root if something is to be changed in the long term. So, if underdeveloped countries are given a serious chance of development, then the equality and social justice that degrowth wants, which ultimately goes hand in hand with sustainability, can be achieved. This also applies to political co-determination: Democratic forms of decision-making must be extended to the South (generally as far as possible) so that everyone has a chance to participate in society and its political design.\n\n3) Finally, systems such as "tracing systems" should be further expanded. This will enable consumers to trace where their clothes (or food \uf0e0 it is versatile) come from and to increase their awareness by focusing on regional products, which will also contribute to more sustainability.\n\nTherefore, we need to show initiative to achieve greater equality, social justice, environmental sustainability and the overall well-being of all humanity. A first step in the right direction would be, for example, to accept the idea that continuous economic growth is in direct negative correlation with environmental sustainability and resource consumption.'}, {'author': 'snuzzbobble', 'comment': "I get the intention but the message isn't the best and doesn't really align with what most people in sustainable fashion circles would advise:"}]}

Beyond this, you have fialed to report the death of 7 protesters including a new born child , the attack carried out at night inside the resting and peace zones. Moreover, the national media in Ecuador at the moment cannot be trusted, they have evident alliance with the goverment. Nine alternative channels of information have been closed down since the protest started and many journalist encarcerated. Prestigious journals have the responsability to present the entire story, even more so when the freedom of being in disagreement is in danger. As a considated media who is serious about a well researched and fact oriented news, it is foolish to believe that in this state of unrest the "truthful" side, lies with the goverment.

Especially when it comes to humanity’s many traditions, rituals and practices surrounding death (and not just humans, of course, even some animals mourn). I’m especially interested in the exploration of death within life - a recognition of how death has many forms and isn’t just the death of the physical body. Clarissa Pinkola Estes calls this the Life Death Life cycle, and an exploration of how this relates to health (both physical and mental) and ecology is something I’ve thought on a lot. And then there’s the presence of death rituals while a person is still alive to mark the end of one self and the beginning of another, such as the shamanic deaths that novice shamans will undergo before they have “graduated” as such. Mircea Eliade talks about this. And of course, reincarnation, not as a topic for debate, but as an example of how our attitudes towards death may strongly shape how we live. If you don’t believe this is your only life, how might that affect the decisions you make, compared to say the idea of YOLO? There’s a lot of mysticism that surrounds death, and I agree with Kahlil Gibran when he says that the answers to death are found in life: “You would know the secret of death.\nBut how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life?\n...\nIf you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life.” Anyway, what an amazing topic to be exploring in a culture that puts SO much energy into avoiding it (the push to look and act young; a fear of old age and a disregard for the value of age and death, as is demonstrated by the loss of “elders” within society; the “fight” against disease, rather than say the embrace of death and illness as a powerful spiritually and psychologically transformative process, etc).

Thats just rubbish. It was ill defined and poorly thought out. Its execution was always going to be a farce. The UK isent a "nation" its definitely not a unitary state(which you seem to think it is for some baffling reason). It is a UNION of nations of which Scotland has always been sovereign within the UK. Its simply never been an issue before as between 1707-1998 and devolution the English parliament had successfully decapitated that nation. Now Brexit causes a problem as a sovereign Scotland has both the technically & practical ability to exercise their will. Also since 1998 & the GFA, Northern Ireland has defacto sovereignty deriving from the UN garunteed peace treaty. In other words due to it voting no to leaving the status quo. That should have killed any brexit stone dead. You see they was a UK wide non binding opinion poll. If it had had to be a legal legitimate one due to the existing legal status of NI. It could never have been applied legally to NI. Since 1998 only people in NI have the explicit right to alter their constitutional status. Leaving the EU yanks them away from Ireland & puts a border back up. This radically alters their constitutional status without their consent as they voted to remain in the EU. Further more the UK abdicated direct sovereignty over NI in 1998 declaring no future ambition to dictate its economic or constitutional future. Brexit does both of those things. So Brexit is basically a vote to renage on promises & treaties & to reassert a territorial claim to NI. Why is this a problem? It forces Ireland to also reassert its former claim as the UK is back to its old imperialistic tricks. If you wish for brexit to happen simply exit the UK as Scotland proposed. Everyone would get what they want. NI,Scotland & Wales would get to stay in the EU like they want(yes Wales has flipped, more than flipped, they\'re indy movement is gathering pace at a startling pace).'}, {'author': 'atm19_70', 'comment': 'Oddly the British Court were fine with it #gofigure!', 'hashtags': ['gofigure']}, {'author': 'ramo15m', 'comment': "It's a shame the country never stood up like this when we went to illegal wars and killed millions of innocent people.

I think the lgbtq+ movement is doing alot to make people aware of this tiny minority of people and hopeful they get less judged for it. 👍 What i do have an issue however is where the somewhat authoritarian ideology of 'you must accept all transgender identities no matter what' extends to children. 😢 All the scientific literature suggests that an overwhelming majority of children who express gender atypical behaviour just grow up to be gay, and that the majority of children who experience gender dysphoria have an underlying mental health issue, a history of abuse, autism, personality disorder or a range of other reasons..or just grow out of it. This is the SCIENCE! 💡But sadly doctors are being held hostage because to suggest that a child's discomfort and confusion about their own body is due to something else is seen as transphobic and not affirming the child's identity which could lose them their jobs, so really young kids get labelled as trans and are being given untested, unapproved, life changing chemicals and puberty blockers which is not only permenant, but cause infertility and likely exacerbate any trauma or mental health problems they may already have. This is an ideology and it needs to seriously be looked at everyone needs to be able to have open conversations about. Everyone should be free to be, love, and express themselves however they want. But please lets stop ignoring SCIENCE and stop pushing these ideas into our children.😢"}, {'author': 'hermanycats', 'comment': '😻 this is so uplifting'}]}

They’ve dispersed, and they’ll continue to pose a threat to Britain, and that is why we will always remain vigilant.” As the fight against Isis enters a new chapter, attention is increasingly turning to the complex issues surrounding captured fighters, as well as women and children.

I 100% agree this was unfair and the blame falls directly onto the organisers and the race directors. However I think part of the reason would have been safety, two pelotons merging would be incredibly dangerous with the speed of these riders. The second would also be a logistic stand point. For example if she did pass through and join the men’s peloton she would have her support car trying to push through a group of female and Male riders in ordered to get within distance to which they could support her. Third thing is she would have eventually been dropped and the men would have left her, no matter what people think unless she was chasing an amateur level men’s peloton she would have been dropped. If she hadn’t been dropped to sit in a Male only peloton would have been a very easy way to sit in a fast breakaway and do no work. Men overall ride faster than women in a competitive environment, this would’ve been an unfair advantage for the rest of female peloton. If she dropped that far back once the race had been paused then she had clearly spent herself very early on. That would have cause dangerous situations for not just riders but staff in cars and spectators. All things considering though I still do feel sorry for her, in this situation I think it was unfortunately the safest option the organisers had. That does not make it right however. This female rider should have kept her overall lead and not had the ability to catch the male group.'}, {'author': 'amelia_waree', 'comment': '@em.whitaker interesting 💪🏻', 'mentions': ['em.whitaker']}]}

He set up a Camtraptions camera trap that has wireless motion sensors in the hope of photographing the animal at night. In his blog, Burrard-Lucas described the moment he returned to his cameras to find the striking images. “As I scrolled through the images on the back of the camera, I paused and peered at the photograph below in incomprehension", he says. "I couldn’t believe it and it took a few days before it sank in that I had achieved my dream.” The leopard\'s sooty black coat is a result of melanism, the opposite of albinism, and this region is the only known spot in Africa where they exist.\n\nPhotos: @willbl/Burrard-Lucas Photography/Camtraptions camera trap', 'mentions': ['willbl', 'willbl']}, {'author': 'crystal.painter', 'comment': '@safari_princess', 'mentions': ['safari_princess']}, {'author': 'angelamunozcardenas', 'comment': 'Que bella.'}, {'author': 'ginalouisehairstylist', 'comment': '@jazlyn.alexander', 'mentions': ['jazlyn.alexander']}, {'author': 'roarafrica', 'comment': 'Extraordinaire.'}, {'author': 'marie_lanne', 'comment': '@clotildelbd', 'mentions': ['clotildelbd']}, {'author': 'marie_lanne', 'comment': '@minamansuroglu ❤️', 'mentions': ['minamansuroglu']}, {'author': 'a_few_road_trips_and_some_food', 'comment': 'Fuk that.

After a little research, its clear that scientists can now blame individual natural disasters on climate change with some degree of accuracy. This degree of accuracy can only rise. Should a disaster be due to climate change, I propose that the top 10% or so of polluting corporations within each country be held responsible. Currently, the blame in both the media and the people, rests on the infrastructure and city responsible for ensuring they're ready for any natural disaster that may befall a city, rather than companies responsible (as in this incident).

The 18-year-old\'s story quickly gathered momentum and support around the world, after she used Twitter to publicise her plight, abuse and her decision to renounce Islam. Qunun hopes her ordeal encourages other women to be "brave and free." In Saudi Arabia women are still denied basic freedoms and are not allowed to work, marry and travel without the permission of a male guardian. Canada\'s prime minister Justin Trudeau said Canada is a country that "understands how important it is to stand up for human rights, to stand up for women’s rights around the world." But Qunun\'s family have released a statement saying they have disowned her and described her as "mentally unstable."

Today, China shared pictures showing a rocky surface with the jagged edges of craters in the background. Among the images is this 360-degree panorama stitched together from 80 photos. Researchers hope that low-frequency observations of the cosmos from the far side of the moon, where radio signals from Earth are blocked, will help scientists learn more about the early days of the solar system and the birth of the universe’s first stars. The pioneering landing also highlights China’s ambitions to rival the US, Russia and Europe with its space programme.\nPhoto: CNSA'}, {'author': 'gilljohnson4', 'comment': 'Love it 👍👍👍👍🔝🔝'}, {'author': 'juliaoliveira9294', 'comment': 'Nice desert of Alabama'}, {'author': 'tweetly_digest', 'comment': 'Fascinating picture'}, {'author': '_ijasleo_____', 'comment': '❤️❤️'}, {'author': 'ahintofbrandy', 'comment': '😍😍😍'}, {'author': 'katl___', 'comment': '@maximilian__holzer', 'mentions': ['maximilian__holzer']}, {'author': 'dalesdennis', 'comment': "God, it's a barren featureless desert out there!"}, {'author': 'sandrasg60', 'comment': "C'est vraiment impressionnant!👏👏👏"}, {'author': 'gatluokboth', 'comment': "Human , you're still interested in exploring the Haven,why are you wasting your resources building rock s rather than helping the people who are in need ???"}, {'author': 'mastqla', 'comment': 'Cool'}, {'author': 'paulbebich', 'comment': 'CGI this is another Hollywood studio'}, {'author': 'paulbebich', 'comment': 'So fake 😂'}]}

Retribution is necessary for those who knowingly/ intentionally/ willfully violate the freedom of others. Bad actors that are getting away with harm, and not being called out, and required to repair damages, and reform themselves, are a terrible/worrisome reflection on our cultures.

Organisers estimate that three million women protested a ban on women of menstruating age approaching the Hindu Sabarimala temple. The deity Lord Ayyappa is celibate, so traditionalists believe women under 50 should not enter the temple to offer prayers for fear that they could “tempt” him. Despite India\'s supreme court overturning the ban in 2018, some were denied entry to one of Hinduism\'s holiest temples by conservative protestors. The "women\'s wall" protest was organised by the left-wing government in the southern Indian state to make a stand against discrimination.\nPhotos: T Sudheesh via Twitter + AFP/Getty Images + Prakash Elamakkara/EPA'}, {'author': 'corners.of.my.world', 'comment': '@liamdonnelly89', 'mentions': ['liamdonnelly89']}, {'author': 'gavarnieaec', 'comment': 'This is archaic stuff bout women!😢'}, {'author': 'sahu.komal', 'comment': 'These men who protest and pray so loudly and keep out menstruating women would not be born if it wasnt for the very same mentruating women who gae birth to them!
