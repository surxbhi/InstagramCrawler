Bernie Sanders took the stage at his campaign rally in Phoenix Thursday night, cheers were replaced by deafening boos when Sanders’s supporters noticed that one man standing behind the senator in an upper section of the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum was holding a red flag above his head — and it was emblazoned with a swastika. While people near the unidentified protester quickly ripped the offending item out of his hands and he was removed from the arena, the mere appearance of a Nazi flag at an event dedicated to a democratic socialist who could become the country’s first Jewish president sparked outcry. The moment, captured in videos and photos that circulated on social media Thursday night, was denounced as an act of anti-Semitism and prompted increased concerns about Sanders’s safety on the campaign trail. The swastika flag was just one incident involving protesters that disrupted Thursday’s event. Later in the night, other people waving banners bearing President Trump’s name also got into minor scuffles with Sanders supporters and were promptly removed from the venue by uniformed officers.

In a 2017 study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology it was found that 50% of participants with even “normal” cholesterol levels had atherosclerosis. It is important to note that dietary cholesterol can only be obtained through consuming animal products. So the 70 billion farmed animals that are exploited and killed per year are killed needlessly out of pleasure, rather than sustenance. Killing animals for food is an act of unnecessary violence driven by sadistic pleasure. What would you do if you saw a stranger beating a puppy for fun? Would you intervene? Call the police? Now how can you stand up for some animals while you also mutilate, enslave and kill other animals merely for taste pleasure? How much do you have to hate an animal to kill them and cause them to suffer even at the expense of your own health? You can easily prevent innocent beings from being exploited and killed on your behalf by being vegan. Look into it on your own, watch Dominion on YouTube, message me for more information and a 22 day vegan challenge 👍🌱'}, {'author': 'susanstone393', 'comment': 'Where the hell were the secret service? !!!!!'}, {'author': 'danimahones', 'comment': 'It was not such a big deal🙄 stop praising everything the Biden’s do.'}]}

Vermont will ultimately award 16 delegates at the national convention, the fewest of the Super Tuesday states and about 1 percent of the total delegates allotted tonight.

But lately, in ways both small and seismic, Thomas Jefferson’s town has started to feel like it belongs to someone else. For the first time since World War II, Charlottesville won’t honor the Founding Father’s birthday this spring. Instead, on Tuesday, the city will celebrate the demise of the institution with which Jefferson increasingly has become associated: slavery. Liberation and Freedom Day, as the new holiday is known, will commemorate when Union troops arrived here on March 3, 1865, and freed the enslaved people who made up a majority of Charlottesville’s residents. The switch is the latest sign of a city struggling to come to grips with its past. The reckoning began with the legal fight over Charlottesville’s Confederate monuments, which inspired white supremacists to stage the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally.

The temperature dwindled to single digits. Ethel Rae Stewart Smith, who taught two dozen black children in that schoolhouse, had run out of coal for the potbelly stove. She thought back to a visit, years earlier, from the white superintendent, Oscar Emerick. She recalled his promise: “If you need anything,” he had said, surveying her school, “don’t fail to let me know.” She reached for a pen. “Dear Mr. Emerick,” the 28-year-old teacher wrote, “please send some coal up right away. All we have left is dirt and that doesn’t half burn.” Half a century later, Smith’s words have emerged through the discovery of more than 10,000 pages of records capturing the history of Loudoun County’s all-black, rural schoolhouses between the end of the Civil War and desegregation in the 1970s. The records, left to molder for decades in an abandoned building, include report cards, curriculums, class rosters, health and insurance records, photographs and faded maps. Since 2016, an all-volunteer team of Loudoun residents, historians and high school students has sifted through the musty, dusty pages to distill an almost-lost history. The documents — unearthed by school officials acting on a tip — are probably the largest collection of black school records found anywhere in the nation, historians say.

And when he opened the door, his 6-year-old, Wyatt, was not there to greet him. He was instead met by gunfire. A bullet that seemed to come from the basement door sliced across his forehead. The lights were on in the room belonging to his older son, Levi, but there was no sign of him. In the living room, there was what looked like a large pile of blankets on the floor. When he pulled back the blanket, he found his wife, Jen, facedown in a pool of blood. Underneath another blanket on the love seat was the small body of Wyatt. “No, this isn’t real,” Norwood recalled screaming. It was another day before he learned where his older son was. On Saturday, Levi was charged with two counts of murder, setting off a manhunt for the teen. As he grieves for his wife and first-grader, Norwood also wrestles with anger toward his elder child, whom he now refers to only as “the one who took them away.” With no clear motive named in the family tragedy, Norwood has also had to defend himself against accusations of racism that some suspect played a role. Four classmates told The Post that Levi described his father as racist. A Facebook page belonging to Norwood is adorned with a notorious white supremacist motto known as the “14 words”: “We must secure the existence of our race, and a future for white children.” And a close relative said Norwood was upset that Levi was dating a black girl.

Trump defended his actions, saying he has the right to shape the country’s legal systems as he sees fit. “I’m allowed to be totally involved,” he told reporters as he left Washington on Tuesday for a trip to California, Nevada and Arizona. “I’m actually, I guess, the chief law enforcement officer of the country.

On one side of the judge, he could see his lawyers, ready to argue that he should be freed immediately. Across from them was a lawyer for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, there to argue that Kevin should be deported. And in front of them all, inside a thick folder, was an old report from a shelter for immigrant children that was the reason the long-running matter of Kevin Euceda existed at all: “Youth reports history of physical abuse, neglect, and gang affiliation in country of origin. Unaccompanied child self-disclosed selling drugs. Unaccompanied child reports being part of witnessing torturing and killing, including dismemberment of body parts,” the report said. The person who had signed it: A therapist at a government shelter for immigrant children who had assured Kevin that their sessions would be confidential. This kind of information sharing was part of a Trump administration strategy that is technically legal but which professional therapy associations say is a profound violation of patient confidentiality. To bolster its policy of stepped up enforcement, the administration is requiring that notes taken during mandatory therapy sessions with immigrant children be passed onto ICE, which can then use those reports against minors in court.

Later, Noah explains that his work to diversify the staff is not “zero-sum.” Grinning, he promises: “I’m not going to fire white guys.” What is Noah looking for in an endless scroll of headlines, which he starts checking on his phone before he gets out of bed? “I’m trying to find the zeitgeist of the day,” he says later. He wants “The Daily Show” to “run the gamut of news, from the dumbest, most ridiculous, inconsequential stories that mean nothing in your life, all the way through to the war that may be happening between America and Iran.” He also wants to analyze societal issues that aren’t necessarily news-pegged or anchored at the White House, reeling off a list of issues such as race inequality, climate change, police shootings and student debt, and exemplified by a recent episode about mental health stigma in the black community.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden, and another in his late 30s, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg. Another, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, is waiting to pounce, depending on the results of the first four primaries and caucuses. The fact that this is a battle among white men represents an unexpected turn for a party whose success in the 2018 midterms depended heavily on an outpouring of support and activism by women and whose failure in 2016 was the result, in part, of a falloff in turnout among voters of color, especially African Americans.

For the first time ever, all are women. “It’s such a contrast to the ancient days when I was in law school,” Ginsburg said during a gathering in Washington to mark the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. “There really is no better time for women to enter the legal profession.” The event in part celebrated the statistical improbability of an all-female sweep of elections at the leading publications of legal scholarship at schools including Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Georgetown and Duke universities. The editors in chief collaborated for the first time to publish a Women & Law journal with a series of essays from prominent female lawyers. But there was also recognition, as the women came together dressed in dark power suits, of the reality that men still dominate the ranks of law firms, the federal judiciary and academia.

Dubbed the “super-fast hospital” by the state-owned China Daily newspaper, construction of the 1,000-bed Huoshenshan hospital began formally on Jan. 25. Officials hope the facility will relieve pressure on Wuhan’s already overcrowded medical institutions, where some seeking care have been turned away because of a shortage of beds and basic supplies. It comes as the World Health Organization has cautioned against panic about the outbreak and praised China’s efforts to contain it, even as fears of transmission have continued to grow. The new facility is opening as many residents of Wuhan have opted to stay home even if they are sick, citing limited beds and fears they may fall sick at hospitals. But even in the early days of Huoshenshan’s construction, it quickly became apparent that the facility would not be large enough to mitigate bed shortages as the virus continues to spread.

Then, something changed.\nA populist presidential campaign characterized by hateful rhetoric against “the other” — Latinx and Muslim immigrants among them — proved successful, and soon other politicos and personalities adopted the trend, both domestically and abroad. Xenophobia became a winning platform.\nThe result where #Socrates’ novel was concerned? Sales shot up, noticeably.\nIn an op-ed for The Guardian this summer, Plato noted that his book was suddenly being referred to as “timely” and “prescient.” “What seemed absolutely shocking and absurd to folks back then,” he explained, “was all of a sudden…more relatable.”\nSo his new #publisher, D.C. based #MAGA led by Anthony Scaramucci Publishing, saw an opportunity. This book written by hand in Greek Ink, using acidophilus as the binding method on ancient parchment is being re-released. It’s available for pre-order now on Amazon, with a new foreword by prominent Latina fiction writer President Donald #Trump\nWith only 657,000 Hand signed by president Trump copies available...Trump supporters need to preorder NOW in order to get a copy of this limitation Limited edition.

During his prodigious basketball career, that flying vehicle became a symbol of his persistent greatness and the urgency he always felt.\nHe didn’t have much time for traffic or any other limitations of road travel. He needed to be faster and more efficient. He needed to go higher. And he needed it now, now, now. Although longevity played a major role in cementing his legend, Bryant lasted 20 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers one restless day at a time. And in a little more than three years since his retirement, he had transitioned to storyteller and built a promising entertainment company, Granity Studios, with the same pressing desire to beat the clock. On Sunday, as the shocking news of his death turned a hopeful new year somber, the tragedy made his rush understandable, sadly. He couldn\'t have known he would get only 41 years as Kobe Bryant, the mesmerizing basketball superstar and enigmatic cultural icon. But he seemed to understand the fleeting nature of his fame — of his life — and he managed to accomplish more than almost anyone could." Go to the link in our bio to read the full column.

In Islam the term to define Allah is Tawhid. Tawhid defines the "Oneness of Allah". Allah is the Supreme Being. He has no associates. No one or anything is associated with Allah. This difference between Christianity and Islam is made clear in Chapter 8 where the Pillars of Islam are defined.

Mess Attendant 2nd Class Doris Miller was deep into the day’s laundry when the blast sent one of his lieutenant’s racing to sound the alarm. Miller, the 19-year-old son of Texas sharecroppers, was just two years into his naval service. He enlisted hoping to see the world and perhaps come home with the prospects of a good job. The Navy was segregated, and mess was the only duty in which black men like Miller were allowed to serve. He had no gunnery training; in the heat of battle, he would be expected to feed ammunition to the white man operating one of the ship’s .50-caliber Browning antiaircraft machine guns. The torpedo blast destroyed Miller’s ammo that day, and he was forced to the deck, where he carried injured sailors to safety. But even without gun training, Miller knew he could do more to save his crew. He jumped behind one of the unmanned Brownings, swung it skyward and fired until his belt was empty and crew members were ordered to abandon ship. After Dec. 7, Miller was hailed in news reports only as an “unnamed Negro messman hero.”\nMiller wouldn’t remain anonymous forever. Months later, he was recognized for his heroics by the Pittsburgh Courier, the influential African American weekly newspaper. He was the first black recipient of the Navy Cross medal — the highest decoration after the Medal of Honor. And 78 years later, the Navy will name a $12.5 billion aircraft carrier in his honor, the Honolulu Star Adviser first reported, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Go to the link in our bio to read more.

This means that they worship one God. This is made abundantly clear in chapter 8 where the definitions are given for each faith. For Christianity, the term Trinity defines God revealing himself in three distinct but equal persons. These are God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son of God and the person of the Holy Spirit. In Islam the term to define Allah is Tawhid. Tawhid defines the "Oneness of Allah". Allah is the Supreme Being. He has no associates. No one or anything is associated with Allah. This difference between Christianity and Islam is made clear in Chapter 8 where the Pillars of Islam are defined. Chapter 9 continues with a side by side comparison of text from the Quran and the Bible. This book is a real eye-opener to understanding Islam and being able to share with our Muslim friends, coworkers, and neighbors.'}, {'author': 'jadetalks', 'comment': '🙌🏻 A true American hero bravely serving his nation in the face of grave danger! 🇺🇸'}, {'author': 'jadetalks', 'comment': 'A teenager at the time!!

But the moment also outraged Trump allies, with many saying the Democratic leader undermined her past efforts to frame impeachment as a solemn constitutional duty rather than a political victory. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blasted the commemorative pens Thursday as evidence of the bias he and other Trump supporters have long alleged in the impeachment process.

Flown in from the San Diego Zoo in 1976, the extremely sexually active tortoise went on to father upward of 800 offspring. His considerable effort helped his species, known scientifically as Chelonoidis hoodensis, rebound to a population of 2,000. It also turned him into a star, his sexual prowess the subject of articles in newspapers across the globe. Now, the ancient tortoise is headed for retirement. Officials with the Galapagos National Park announced Friday that the breeding program has been so successful that it is being terminated. Diego, believed to be more than 100 years old, will be released from captivity and returned to the wild. Go to the link in our bio to read more.

While most experts believe Iran will not risk a direct military attack on U.S. assets, the threat of its launching a painful counterstrike — such as a truly crippling blow against Persian Gulf oil facilities, or an attack on Israel — could affect U.S. calculations if the crisis escalates further.

But over the centuries, they were mythologized by generations of humans. Locals believed they carried the souls of their ancestors. Scientists saw the migration as the proof of insect evolution — a brittle organism that could fly 6,000 miles a year to avoid severe weather.\nNow, the monarch has morphed into a different kind of symbol. One of the world's oldest, most resilient species could be decimated — and soon — by climate change. The butterflies are among the world’s experts in climate adaptation. They spend their summers in the northern United States and Canada; they breed in the southern United States during the fall and spring; and most spend their winters here in Central Mexico, in a few giant clusters. Their life cycles are driven by a search for optimal conditions: temperatures ideally between 55 and the low 70s when they migrate, some rain during their winters and plenty of milkweed when they mate.

He attended group therapy with teens accused of rape, when what he really needed was grief therapy to process his mother’s death. Daily life became so torturous that Geard scratched up his face to look like a methamphetamine addict, hoping that “they would transfer me to somewhere more normal, like rehab.” Geard’s only crime was being a foster child in an era when a surging number of biological parents are falling into the grips of drug addiction and child welfare systems are struggling with a shortage of foster parents. In hasty attempts to address the problem, case workers and courts have been funneling children into crowded emergency shelters, hotels, out-of-state institutions and youth prisons — cold, isolating and often dangerous facilities not built to house innocent children for years.

But when he and his wife moved back to the four-square-mile outpost off Newfoundland’s northeastern coast in 2017, he never imagined they’d be its last inhabitants. Parsons, 53, remembers Little Bay Islands as a thriving village of hundreds at the center of the province’s booming cod fishing industry, a postcard of bucolic bliss with its green forested hills, brightly painted saltbox homes, bustling shops and lively dockyards huddled around a small blue harbor. Now, it’s down to some 54 souls, most of them in their twilight years. A moratorium on commercial cod fishing in 1992 prompted many to look elsewhere for work. The fishing plant shuttered in 2010. The school sits empty. For years, the only items for sale in the village have been the stamps at the post office. The strains on Little Bay Islands — emigration, resource collapse, aging populations — are familiar to small towns around the world. Local leaders have tried to revive dying villages with offers of $1 homes or promises to pay would-be residents to move in. Newfoundland and Labrador takes a different approach: It pays you to leave. Faced with mounting debt and still struggling to recover from a fishery collapse and an oil-price slump, the government pays households in declining, expensive-to-serve communities $190,000 to $205,000 to move — and then cuts off services to the community.

Kellie Thomas waited a minute before walking over. “I know you’re going to hate me,” she said, placing a hand on 18-year-old Noah Montgomery’s shoulder pad. “But your health is more important to me than this game.” Montgomery took his helmet off and began to cry. A medical condition had kept him off the field for weeks, and before the game he and Thomas agreed he would have to sit out the team’s game on senior night. But all he had wanted was one last chance to play for the Hannan Wildcats. He wrapped his arms around his coach, finally accepting that his football career was over, as the rest of the players watched in silence. They all knew her for moments such as this. They never call her Coach — just Kellie. She is the first female high school football head coach in West Virginia, yet when she took over two seasons ago, she had little interest in making history or worrying about the team’s win total. She was more concerned with protecting her players, using football to help them navigate the everyday challenges brought on by the state’s opioid epidemic, which has been especially cruel in rural and economically diminished places such as here in Mason County.

The discomfort became so severe in middle and high school that it had been hard to even get out of bed. “I won’t make it past high school,” Eli had often thought. Then in the past year or two, life had begun to brighten. After trying and discarding various gender and sexual identities, one had finally clicked: non-binary, meaning Eli didn’t identify with being fully male or female. There is no reliable research on how many Americans identify as non-binary, but the gender identity is increasingly visible in popular culture, on college campuses and in workplaces. But the world is still largely a binary place, especially for older Americans like Eli’s parents. Scott and Susan are in their 50s, devout Catholics and political conservatives who grew up in small-town America. The family struggled for years to keep up with Eli’s ever-changing conception of self. Read more by clicking the link in our bio. (Photo by Toni L.

At stake, too, is the future of thousands of children born into the caliphate through no fault of their own. Women contributed to the Islamic State’s propaganda and often became complicit in its crimes. Bint Fatma was among some 20,000 women who would stick it out to the end, when the last redoubt of the caliphate was overrun by U.S.-backed forces early this year and its final denizens were trucked to internment camps. The Post first met the young woman in late July near the entrance to the sprawling al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, home to about 70,000 women and children. With conditions deteriorating and radicals cementing control inside the camp, Bint Fatma described al-Hol as a “different world.” She wanted to go home to the Netherlands, where she is from, but knew the government was leery. The story of how her government — and others around the world — would decide the fate of the Islamic State women and children was fast becoming a historic test of what countries in the West and beyond were made of.

He took one pill to ease a headache, which turned into nine-month habit. “I got up to 20 to 30 Percocets a day,” the former Air Force doctor said. “I was eating them like M&Ms.” In 2018, 47,590 people died of an opioid overdose, and more than 2 million suffer from opioid addiction disorder, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. The rising death and addiction toll has followed a decade-long surge in the distribution of prescription opioids — according to federal data, more than 76 billion pills flooded the country from 2006 to 2012. Medical experts say genetics account for about half of the risk of addiction, but mental health issues, violence in the home and access to drugs also contribute. Law enforcement officials blame illegal drug diversion by corrupt doctors and an overabundance of supply sent out by drug companies that fail to properly monitor suspicious orders. The companies blame bad doctors and individuals who abuse their products. Earlier this year, The Washington Post asked readers to share their stories about how opioids have affected their communities. More than 700 people responded. Hundreds wrote about the devastation to their hometowns, their families and themselves. Scores of chronic-pain patients said they needed opioids to live full lives and were concerned about efforts to restrict the supply during what they believed to be a period of hysteria about opioids.

The contrast is shaping up to be a key theme of the 2020 presidential race. Trump’s anti-environmentalism message was encapsulated in a weekend speech to a conservative group in South Florida that included a diatribe against wind-powered turbines — arguing that building them produces “a tremendous amount of fumes” and that the “windmills,” as he calls them, are noisy, unattractive and kill too many birds. Often operating on his own feelings rather than scientific evidence, the president has castigated Democrats’ environmental agenda as unworkable and counterproductive. Trump has made the same nostalgic appeal on other issues — ranging from his mocking of the #MeToo movement to his unfounded claim that his election allowed people to say “Merry Christmas” again. But when it comes to energy-related issues, the regulatory moves of Trump’s administration have easily merged with his campaign messaging. Read more by clicking the link in our bio.

On New Year’s Eve 1989, Hasselhoff hovered in a bucket crane over a crowd of thousands who had gathered to celebrate the collapse of the Berlin Wall. He had come there to sing his German pop hit, “Looking for Freedom.” He wasn’t expecting to become an enduring part of the city’s history.

But then that nursing home went bankrupt and closed in May, one of more than 260 rural nursing facilities across the country to shut down for financial reasons in the past three years, sending another family on a desperate search for the basic medical care that is disappearing from rural America. Marlene tried to get Earl into the only other nursing home in Broken Bow, but that facility had managed to stay solvent in part by limiting the number of residents on Medicaid, as Earl was, because the federal program pays nursing homes in Nebraska about $40 less per day than the cost of providing care. The nursing homes in Ainsworth and Minden had already closed, and the one located next to a grain elevator in Callaway was running a waiting list. The best option Marlene could find was a shared room in the town of Cozad, more than 50 miles away down remote two-lane roads, and Marlene had been making the trip back and forth several times each week ever since. She and Earl had rarely traveled outside of Nebraska, and they’d never been on an airplane. Many of their trips together in recent years had been medical trips, the escalating cost of a life spent in rural America, which in the past decade has lost at least 250 maternity wards, 115 hospitals, 3,500 primary care doctors, 2,000 medical specialists and hundreds of nursing homes. Marlene and Earl had traveled together to Lincoln for a heart operation, Kearney for an ankle, Grand Island for a hip, Omaha for corneal transplants, and then finally to Cozad in the back of a nursing home transport van for what Marlene feared would be Earl’s final trip. He was almost 88, and he could no longer walk or eat solid foods. Marlene had already paid for their adjacent cemetery plots in Broken Bow, where Earl had spent his entire adult life, but there was no place left in town where he could live safely until he died.

The lack of recognition for women working behind the scenes is not out of character for the Golden Globes, which have only nominated five female directors throughout the past 76 ceremonies. Barbra Streisand is the only woman to have won, which she did for 1983′s “Yentl.” Ava DuVernay, one of the other four women, was notably snubbed this year for her critically acclaimed miniseries “When They See Us.” Read more by clicking the link in our bio.'}, {'author': 'marciazellers', 'comment': 'Shameful'}, {'author': 'debpricesinclair', 'comment': 'Grrrrrrrrrr😡'}, {'author': 'freebal12', 'comment': 'Lmao omg'}, {'author': 'auntholly321', 'comment': 'This is so wrong.

The march, which was approved by authorities, was one of the biggest peaceful protests seen in the city for months and underscores the strong support that still exists for greater democratic freedoms in Hong Kong, despite a crackdown that has seen police fire over 10,000 tear gas canisters, rubber bullets and arrest some 6,000 people.

For the collector who paid an eye-popping $120,000 last week for an Art Basel installation depicting just that, the answer is yes. How about if you pull that pricey piece of fruit off the wall, peel it and eat it in front of a crowd of confused onlookers? Does that count as art, too? Definitely, according to David Datuna, a New York-based performance artist who put his own, apparently unauthorized, spin on the installation that became a viral sensation after it went up at Galerie Perrotin in Miami Beach last week. Titled “Comedian,” the piece by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan consisted of a single overripe banana duct-taped to a wall at the gallery. Starting Thursday, people flocked to the show to snap pictures of the curious installation, which drew a mix of bemusement, mockery and genuine interest as it made international headlines and popped up in the Instagram feeds of users from around the world. But on Saturday afternoon, in full view of a throng of Art Basel attendees, Datuna strolled up to the work, removed the taped banana from the wall, and casually ate it.

The North Carolina county has removed 460 structures and replaced them with absorbent grasslands, winning national praise as a prototype for regional flood planning that anticipates the impact of projected development and the growing effects of extreme weather. The innovative strategy was ahead of the curve when it launched in the 1990s, by calculating future flood risk and then purchasing — and demolishing — vulnerable homes, businesses and office buildings. But the region is facing more-complex challenges as climate change threatens bigger and more-lasting deluges. Six of North Carolina’s seven wettest storms have occurred in the past 20 years. In June, following an 11-inch downpour upstream, the Catawba River burst its banks here in a catastrophe that can’t be cured by opening up a few extra acres of flood plain.

The university’s athletic director had spent the previous night in Orlando watching the players — known as the “Black 14” — accept an award and explain how they had been kicked off the team in 1969 after trying to ask their coach if they could wear black armbands during an upcoming game. They had wanted to show solidarity against racism at a time when civil rights protests were common on the nation’s college campuses. Instead, they were immediately banished, sending many of their lives into turmoil. Some transferred away from Wyoming, others left school, never to return and never to receive a degree. Burman hurt for the men as he heard how they had been villainized throughout the state as insubordinate and ungrateful, how most fans sided with their white coach and his strict “no protest” policy. And so, as he drove back to campus in September 2017, Burman decided he had to do something. As it turned out, the school’s president at the time, Laurie Nichols, had been thinking the same thing, working to educate herself on the Black 14 scandal, which remained perhaps the most divisive incident in the school’s 132-year history. When Burman mentioned the idea of trying to repair the university’s relationship with the players, Nichols readily agreed. The university’s probe of its past — and how it treated elite players who had been recruited from across the country — came as institutions across the nation were reexamining their sins of the past.

In a race marked by stalled candidates, early dropouts and late entries, Harris’s long-stalled candidacy stands out as one of the more fluid. At the outset, party leaders viewed her as one of their best chances to beat President Trump. That sense was affirmed at her launch rally in January, when she bounded onto the stage in Oakland and lit into Trump, to the delight of a crowd of more than 22,000 people. But Harris has struggled to re-create that level of enthusiasm.

Our citizens know that we are standing guard, crushing our enemies.” The president served turkey to troops in a cafeteria and posed for photos with many of them.

The president’s aircraft took off without lights and with its cabin window shades drawn shut to preserve operational secrecy.

He retired at halftime, leaving the stadium as the game played on. He feels no compulsion to explain his exit but has no reticence in doing so.

A similar story unfolded citywide: A 23-year-old graduate beat a three-time incumbent in an establishment stronghold; a 25-year-old who crowdfunded his campaign ousted the vice-chairman of the main pro-Beijing party. More than 2.9 million voters — a record turnout — delivered the pro-democracy camp 17 of 18 districts and more than 80 percent of contested seats, the biggest electoral victory for the movement since Hong Kong’s handover from British rule in 1997. But it was also a rare chance for people within China to send their leaders a clear electoral message — that they want democracy, not overbearing control by Beijing, and they were prepared to look past protesters’ violence. With this rebuke of its affiliates in the city, Beijing faces a tough choice: whether to open up politics as promised in Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, extend a crackdown on the pro-democracy protesters by the city’s police force and government, or try to navigate a delicate middle path.

The president’s unsupported attacks on some of the key witnesses appearing over the past two weeks before the House Intelligence Committee not only surprised many of his Republican allies but also contradicted the narrative that they had settled on to describe why Trump’s actions in the Ukraine controversy do not justify his removal from office. Before the impeachment hearings began earlier this month, some Democrats expected that Republicans would concede that Trump’s behavior was impolitic, even inappropriate, but would argue that it simply wasn’t consequential enough to justify him being removed from office. For a while, it appeared that a number of Republicans in Congress were preparing exactly that defense. But it soon became apparent that the strategy had a major flaw that has bedeviled Republicans in Congress for three years: Trump’s eagerness to say whatever seems advantageous to him in a given moment.

She rinsed it with water and out came the source of the irritation — only it wasn’t an errant eyelash or a wayward dust particle. It was a live worm, roughly half an inch long, transparent and wriggling. And it wasn’t alone. Soon after the first worm revealed itself, she plucked another of the squirming critters from her eye, where it had been living in the space between her lower eyelid and eyeball. The woman was infected by a parasitic eye worm known as Thelazia gulosa, a species normally found in cattle. The parasites often spread among cows — their preferred hosts — through certain types of face flies that eat eye secretions, such as tears. The flies the woman ran through were likely larvae carriers, and at least one managed to come in contact with her eyes long enough to leave the parasites behind.

Their limbs were withered and leaves deformed; the wood looked like rot. They were thriving once, but that was before a citrus disease that scientists compare to HIV struck, crippling hundreds of trees and forcing the family to let part of the grove decline, close its juice blending business and put the entire operation up for sale. “I’ve spent the last two years slowly dismantling my father’s dream," Burchenal said of Cee Bee’s Citrus, established by his father, Bill, who died in 2016. "And it feels like crap.” There are so many dead and dying Florida groves like Cee Bee’s that some economists have administered last rites to the state’s $9 billion citrus industry. Ninety percent of the state’s groves are infected by a bacterium called huang long bing, which, like oranges, originated in China. The pathogen often prevents raw green fruit from ripening, a symptom called citrus greening. Even when the fruit does ripen, it sometimes drops to the ground before it can be picked. Under Florida law, citrus that falls from a tree untouched cannot be sold. As the state prepares for the November to May harvest, thousands of growers have already quit, leaving “ghost groves” in their wake. More than 7,000 farmers grew citrus in 2004; since then, nearly 5,000 have dropped out. Go to the link in our bio to read more.

Many allies of President Trump rushed to explain away the poor performance of incumbent Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin as an anomaly, while other GOP veterans expressed alarm about the party’s failure in a state where Trump won by nearly 30 percentage points in 2016. Although Bevin was controversial and widely disliked, he was also a devotee of the president, embracing Trump’s agenda and his anti-establishment persona. And in the contest’s final days, Bevin sought to cast his candidacy as a bulwark against House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry of Trump.

You’re going to find out,” Trump said Monday at a campaign rally. “These are very dishonest people.” It’s a form of gaslighting that has become the central defense strategy for the president as he faces his greatest political threat yet. But the approach is coming under increasing strain as congressional Democrats release transcripts and prepare to hold public hearings presenting evidence that directly undercuts Trump’s claims. Trump’s repetitive use of false claims represents an attempt to immunize himself from impeachment by seeding favorable information in the minds of the public, even when that information is incorrect, experts told The Post.

Carter has been teaching at church since his teens, and refused to miss another Sunday school lesson because of his health. During his lesson, Carter cited his history of health issues as the source of his philosophy on death. In August 2015, he announced he had melanoma — which eventually spread to his brain. Carter said he “assumed, naturally, that I was going to die very quickly.” “I, obviously, prayed about it. I didn’t ask God to let me live, but I just asked God to give me a proper attitude toward death. And I found that I was absolutely and completely at ease with death. It didn’t really matter to me whether I died or lived,” Carter said. “I have, since that time, been absolutely confident that my Christian faith includes complete confidence in life after death."

For weeks, Stern had been courting Jeff Schoep, the longtime leader of the National Socialist Movement, in recorded phone calls. His mission: to persuade Schoep, 45, to turn over the country’s largest neo-Nazi group to a black man. His promise: to get Schoep and his organization removed from a federal lawsuit alleging that he and two dozen other hate groups and their leaders had conspired to commit violence while organizing the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. In 18 phone calls that Stern recorded between December 2018 and February 2019 and provided to The Post, he offered Schoep a simple solution. Give the National Socialist Movement to me, Stern said, and I’ll make the lawsuit disappear. If you change your mind, Stern assured him, I’ll give it back to you. So Schoep quietly wiped his officers’ names from the group’s incorporation paperwork and replaced them with the names of Stern and another black activist. Schoep signed a sworn, notarized affidavit in January confirming it was he who made the changes. He fired his attorneys. He promised to keep it all a secret so his members couldn’t object.

He is the first Nationals player to publicly confirm that, although multiple people close to the team said a handful of players are wrestling with the decision. “There’s a lot of things, policies that I disagree with, but at the end of the day, it has more to do with the divisive rhetoric and the enabling of conspiracy theories and widening the divide in this country.

But as the country stocks up for trick-or-treating this year, chocolate companies are far from meeting that ambitious goal. Worldwide, the pace of deforestation is alarming. In 2017, 40 football fields of tropical forests were lost to deforestation every minute. Much of it is the work of hundreds of thousands of poor cocoa farmers seeking to expand their plots by felling mature trees. Left to rot, those trees no longer capture and store carbon dioxide but instead release it into the atmosphere. The failure to make progress against deforestation has tarnished the image and credibility of the chocolate industry at a time when it is already under fire. The Washington Post reported in June about the use of child labor in West African cocoa fields, which has persisted despite promises decades ago to stop it. Read more by clicking the link in our bio.

He makes Moore feel comfortable in public spaces such as grocery stores and doctors’ offices, where he once couldn’t go without Dawn.

That’s what happens when you beat the home team, 12-3, in Game 2 of the World Series. That’s what happens when you carry a 2-0 lead onto a plane back to Washington. That’s what happens when you stage a six-run seventh inning that starts against star pitcher Justin Verlander and ends with you capitalizing on every last mistake. That’s what the Nationals did at Minute Maid Park. They dismembered the Astros, and in swift fashion, after Stephen Strasburg kept them floating in a tight game. He gave up two runs in six innings of taxing work. He was rewarded once the bats erupted in the seventh. The rally began when Kurt Suzuki rocketed a Verlander fastball out to left.

The newcomer was walking the final steps of an improbable 15,000-mile odyssey. There to greet him were four others who had followed the same epic path to an American life, along with a native-born citizen clutching a hand-drawn, red-and-blue sign: “Welcome to Texas!” None would have been there had Trump had his way. In a nearly three-year campaign that has encompassed walls, travel bans and the forced separation of children from their parents, the Trump administration has reshaped vast tracts of the U.S. government’s approach toward refugees and immigration. But in one of his first attempts to bend policy to his will — an effort to block the arrival of refugees who had been detained by the Australian government on remote South Pacific islands — Trump lost. “I guarantee you they are bad,” the president said during a testy exchange with the Australian prime minister a week after his inauguration. “That is why they are in prison.” Now more than 600 of them are in the United States, living freely from California to Georgia and dozens of places in between. After enduring years locked up by Australia for seeking asylum, they are making the most of their second chance — finding jobs, honing their English and putting down roots in a country half a world away from the one they had intended to reach.

The president has also insisted that his top Democratic and Republican critics on Capitol Hill should be impeached for their efforts against him, despite a centuries-old precedent that prevents such an action.

Now, Trump’s mischaracterizations threaten to overshadow political and tactical arguments that could potentially put Democrats on the defensive and help his case.

A place where the number of visitors is limited, where the money they bring is used to promote electric cars, solar farms and mandatory recycling, where the tourist activities include lectures on climate change and ways to reduce carbon emissions. “The world is turning a page,” says Rocha, the island’s administrator. “The era of dirty energy is over.” Luiz Falcão considers the same tropical paradise and sees untapped potential — for more business. The owner of the Dolphin Hotel dreams of creating a world-class port to welcome cruise ships packed with passengers coming to patronize a growing landscape of bars, restaurants and hotels. “This could be a Maldives, a Cozumel,” he says. “Here, we can have only 100,000 tourists. There, they receive 90\u2009million.” Those competing visions have made Noronha an unlikely battleground in the larger debate over growth across the Western Hemisphere’s second-largest nation. Will Brazil exploit its abundant natural resources to lift itself out of economic stagnation? Or will it use those resources to show humankind the way to a green future?

The federal government now designates nearly 80 percent of rural America as “medically underserved.” It is home to 20 percent of the U.S. population but fewer than 10 percent of its doctors, and that ratio is worsening each year because of what health experts refer to as “the gray wave.” Rural doctors are three years older than urban doctors on average, with half over 50 and more than a quarter beyond 60. Health officials predict the number of rural doctors will decline by 23 percent over the next decade as the number of urban doctors remains flat. In Texas alone, 159 of the state’s 254 counties have no general surgeons, 121 counties have no medical specialists, and 35 counties have no doctors at all. Thirty more counties are each forced to rely on just a single doctor, like Ed Garner, a family physician by training who by necessity has become so much else: medical director of Culberson County. Head physician for a nearby immigration detention center. Director of a rural health clinic. Chief of staff for Culberson Hospital.

Those statements and others in a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were so concerning that the intelligence community inspector general thought them a possible violation of campaign finance law. In late August, intelligence officials referred the matter to the Justice Department as a possible crime, but prosecutors concluded last week that the conduct was not criminal, according to senior Justice Department officials. The administration’s disclosures underscore how the president’s phone call has consumed the federal government in recent days, and how the White House is now scrambling to defuse the situation by offering more details of what the president said.

Once regarded as an interesting but ultimately inconsequential novelty of political campaigns, crowd size is now a potentially meaningful metric of electability — one that can translate into volunteers, donors and, as Trump demonstrated in 2016, actual momentum.

He scrambled into a downtown Charlottesville parking garage, where six men linked to militia or white supremacist groups pummeled his 5-foot-10, 135-pound frame, all of it captured on video seen hundreds of thousands of times. The violence on Aug. 12, 2017 — which left one counterprotester dead and dozens injured — transformed Harris into a symbol of racial strife as the video of the beating went viral. After the beating, Harris needed eight staples to close a gash on his scalp. His left wrist was broken, his front tooth chipped, and he was covered with cuts and bruises.

Defense officials deny claims of abusive confinement and say they must vet everyone who emerges from the restive countryside: Boko Haram and other Islamist groups in Nigeria’s northeast are known for sending children to carry out attacks. But human rights advocates say conditions in the holding centers are so appalling they thwart the military’s goal of protecting — and deradicalizing — young people by breeding resentment of the government.

The findings reflect profound demographic change, as Latinos move into small towns and suburbs that once were overwhelmingly white. These places, The Post found, are far more likely to have schools that mirror the new diversity of their communities than their big-city counterparts, which have long been home to a diverse population but have run schools that are profoundly segregated.

He ducked into a building lobby, and “a woman came in completely covered in gray dust,” Honda recalled in 2011. “You could tell she was nicely dressed for work and for a second she stood in the lobby. I took one shot of her before the police officer started to direct people up a set of stairs, thinking it would be safer off the ground level.” The woman was Marcy Borders, who had recently begun working for Bank of America in the World Trade Center when the first plane struck. She was 28 at the time, and Honda’s haunting photo of her became one of the most iconic images of the worst day in American history. The image — and Borders — became known as “Dust Lady.” Borders became severely depressed and started “smoking crack” in the years after the attack, she told The New York Post, before finally finding “peace of mind” after rehab and the death of 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden. But then, sickness struck: Borders received a diagnosis of stomach cancer in August 2014. She died in 2015 at the age of 42.
