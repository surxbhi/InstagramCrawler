Really? Only an American bank can bring this as a reason for a bad year for the global economy. Sure, US is an important economy. Sure, the president plays a big role in shaping the policies. Having said that, US and its presidential debates in the media, are of little interest to global markets. It will create volatilty which will dissipate a week after the elections are over.\n3) Central bank policy. I am guessing that BoA refers to the FED. Well, this is the only viable point. But, the FED will not act blindly, endangering the economy. Look at previous decisions made by the FED and you will see that they know how to react to the dynamic nature of things.\n\nI didn't want to write such a long comment, but when I see so many idiotic points and such a US-centric view on the global economy, I just can't hold myself :)"}, {'author': 'stockmarketyoda', 'comment': 'It already dropped more than 2008'}, {'author': 'ptyrelojmania', 'comment': 'those Puts making my wallet great again'}, {'author': 'bondtheog', 'comment': 'Buy into the fear on stocks 😂🚀'}, {'author': 'martingamps', 'comment': 'But I’m long tho I always ride it out lol I’m only 22 so I’ll ride it out then.'}, {'author': 'idyllicfutura', 'comment': 'Buy da dip 🔥'}, {'author': 'r.a.u.l.iv', 'comment': 'Woo fire sale on stocks'}, {'author': 'wolff_wolff_', 'comment': 'This makes me want to start investing again 😔😬'}]}

The Virgin Group CEO says one of the strengths people with dyslexia often have is a VIVID imagination, noting that Thomas Edison 💡, Henry Ford 🚗 and Steve Jobs 📱 were all dyslexic.\u2060\n\u2060\nBranson says because of his dyslexia, he was able to think big, but keep his company’s message simple.\u2060\n\u2060\n“The business world often gets caught up in facts and figures — and while the details and data are important, the ability to dream, conceptualise and innovate is what sets the successful and the unsuccessful apart.”\u2060\n\u2060\nAnd he says one day, the skills associated with dyslexia will urgently be needed in the new world of work.\u2060\n\u2060\n“We should stop trying to get all children to think the same way. We should support and celebrate all types of neurodiversity and encourage children’s imagination, creativity and problem solving — the skills of the future.”\u2060\n\u2060\nMore details at the link in bio.
