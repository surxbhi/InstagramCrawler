Educate yourselves and stop whining: 1) The manufacturer, Solari di Udine has ceased the production and supply of spare parts as of 2015. It is not longer possible to source them. 2) The board's maintenance is taxing on manpower as it require frequent high precision tweaking by trained technicians. 3) In an airport where accuracy of info takes priority over aesthetics, a failing board must eventually be replaced. Wrong flight numbers and timinga can mislead passengers."}, {'author': 'damsie64', 'comment': 'Me when I was 9: Mummy can I take picture of that board?
